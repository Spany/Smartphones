Hi! You're looking for my devices? Well... I'll told you how to download these designs.

You can do it in STL format, but you can see this format in the GibHub page without downloading these files. 
Some desings are in .FCStd format. To download this files, you must to download their corresponding .FCStd1 file, and put both in the same folder.
This format is the FreeCad format.

Thank you for visiting my repo! Don't forget that this designs are of my autorithy.
